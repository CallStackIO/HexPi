# HexPi
## Brief
HexPi is a project of mine that has no definitive purpose or function yet. It will act as a way for me to explore mathematics and more specifically, mathematics surrounding pi.
I will document all my research about the various algorithms used and my progress and goals.

Hopefully by the end of it, I will have created something unique.

## Part 1

I was surfing through wikipedia pages when I came across what was called the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula, which is able to calculate an nth digit of pi. 
Upon discovering this, it reignited my interest in mathematics, and I got the sudden urge to create a program that was able to use this formula.
